## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Python is considered general purpose as it can be used for developing a variety of applications like desktop GUI applications, websites and web applications and is
not specialized for a particular problem. 
Python is a high-level programming language because itâ€™s highly readable by humans.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Because we don't have to declare variable type when defining them.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Pros - Simple, Readable, Object-oriented, Free and open source, Portable, Extensible and many more.
Cons - Large Memory consumption, Speed limitation, Not suitable for mobile based applications, Design Restrictions etc.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Web Development, Machine Learning, Data Engineering, Scientific Calculations, etc.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Variables in Python Variables are the names that store the values. We can declare them by assigning a value to them
Example a=5 or first_name = "User"

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

By using input() method. Example inp = input('Please enter you name')

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Default data type is string

Q8. What is type casting?

Converting the data type of an object to another is called type casting

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Yes, we can take multiple inputs in input function. Example below:

a,b=input("Enter the 2 values = ").split()
print("1st value = ",a)
print("2nd value = ",b)

Q10. What are keywords?

Keywords are reserved words. These words hold some special meaning, can be commands, or a parameter etc. We cannot use keywords as variable names.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

No we cannot use keywords as variables, Python compiler does not interpret them as variables.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Indentation in Python means space in the beginning of lines of the code. Python uses it to indicatee a block of code. For example it is used in if-else,
for loops and while loops.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

We can use the print() function to throw output to the screen.

Q14. What are operators in Python?

Operators in Python are used to perform certain operations on variables and values. Few operators are below
 
Arithmetic operator 
Assignment operator
Comparison operator
Logical operator
Boolean operator

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

/ - Divisionn Operator Example 12/2 = 6
// - Floor Division Operator 13/2 = 6

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
s="iNeuron"
print(s*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

num=input("Enter the number ")
num = int(num)
if num%2 == 0:
    print("The number is Even")
else:
    print("The number is Odd")
    
Q18. What are boolean operator?

Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 --> 1

0 and 0 --> 0

True and False and True --> False

1 or 0 or 0 --> 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

They regulate the flow of execution of code based on the defined conditions.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

Used for 

if condition:
  # code
elif condtion:
  # code
else:
  # code

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

age=input("Please enter your age")
age = int(age)
if age >= 18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum = 0
for i in numbers:
    if i%2 == 0:
        sum = sum + i
print("Sum of even numbers = ",sum)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

a,b,c=input("Enter 3 number").split()
if a > b and a > c:
    print("The largest number is =",a)
elif b > a and b > c:
    print("The largest number is =",b)
else:
    print("The largest number is =",c)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for num in numbers:
    if num%5 == 0 and num <= 150:
        print("Number is = ", num)
    if num > 500:
        break
