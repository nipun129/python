## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Python is considered general purpose as it can be used for developing a variety of applications like desktop GUI applications, websites and web applications and is
not specialized for a particular problem. 
Python is a high-level programming language because it’s highly readable by humans.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Because we don't have to declare variable type when defining them.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Pros - Simple, Readable, Object-oriented, Free and open source, Portable, Extensible and many more.
Cons - Large Memory consumption, Speed limitation, Not suitable for mobile based applications, Design Restrictions etc.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Web Development, Machine Learning, Data Engineering, Scientific Calculations, etc.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Variables in Python Variables are the names that store the values. We can declare them by assigning a value to them
Example a=5 or first_name = "User"

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

By using input() method. Example inp = input('Please enter you name')

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Default data type is string

Q8. What is type casting?

Converting the data type of an object to another is called type casting

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Yes, we can take multiple inputs in input function. Example below:

a,b=input("Enter the 2 values = ").split()
print("1st value = ",a)
print("2nd value = ",b)

Q10. What are keywords?

Keywords are reserved words. These words hold some special meaning, can be commands, or a parameter etc. We cannot use keywords as variable names.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

No we cannot use keywords as variables, Python compiler does not interpret them as variables.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Indentation in Python means space in the beginning of lines of the code. Python uses it to indicatee a block of code. For example it is used in if-else,
for loops and while loops.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

We can use the print() function to throw output to the screen.

We can create tuple as below
tup = ("apple, "banana", "mango")

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.

t1 = ()
We cannot add ot remove elements in an existing tuple as it is immutable.

Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?

2 tuples can be appended only by creating a new tuple. Example below
tuple_a = ('a', 'b', 'c')
tuple_b = ('d', 'e', 'f')

type(var)
Output : Set
Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.

s1 = set()
s1.add("iNeuron")

Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.

s1 = set()
s1.add("iNeuron")
s1.add("Big")

set6.add(1)
set6.add(1)
set6.add(2)
set6.add(5)
set6.add(2)
set6.add(1)
set6.add(2)
print(set6) # output is {1, 2, 5}
# update() adds one set named tmp is added into another set set6 but duplicate elements are removed.
tmp = [1,2,5,2,1,3,4,5,6,2,3,5,6]
set6.update(tmp)
print(set6) # Output is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Q50. What is clear() in sets?

set() removes all elements from a set.

Q51. What is frozen set?

Python frozenset() Method creates an immutable Set object from an iterable. It is a built-in Python function.
As it is a set object therefore we cannot have duplicate values in the frozenset.

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?

set is mutable and can have duplicate values but frozen set is immutable and cannot have duplicate values. 

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.

set_a = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
set_b = {3,6,8,9,10}

# Union operation

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.

set_a = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
set_b = {3,6,8,9,10}

# Intersection operation
print(set_a & set_b) # {3, 6}

Q55. What is dictionary ibn Python?

A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. The dictionary keys must be unique. The dictionary value may be of any type.

Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.

Python Dictionary get() Method returns the value for a given key if present in the dictionary.

Q63. What is the use of items() function?

items() method displays a list of a given dictionary’s (key, value) pair.

Q64. What is the use of pop() function?

pop() is an inbuilt function in Python that removes and returns the last value from the List or the given index value.

Q65. What is the use of popitems() function?

popitem() method removes the last inserted key-value pair from the dictionary and returns it as a tuple.

Q66. What is the use of keys() function?

Prints out all the keys in a dictionary.

Q67. What is the use of values() function?

Prints out all the values in a dictionary.

Loops are used to execute a piece of code multiple times or based on a condition.

Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?

While Loops, For Loops

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?

While loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. Here number of iterations is not known.
For loop is used for sequential traversal. The number of iterations is known.

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?

Continue is also a loop control statement just like the break statement. 
It forces to execute the next iteration of the loop.

Q72. What is the use of break statement?

The break statement is used to terminate the loop or statement in which it is present.
After that, the control passes to the statements that are present after the break statement, if available.

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?

The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required but you do not want any command or code to execute.

Q74. What is the use of range() function?

range() function is used to get a range of numbers within a given range. Can be used within loops.

Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?

We can loop over a dictionary as below using item() function
dict2 ={'a':'1','b':'2','c':'3'}
for k,v in dict2.items(): # item() built in function for dictionaries for iterating
    print(k,v)
